# üé≤ Tuple Out Dice Game

## üìã Project Overview
The **Tuple Out Dice Game** is a two-player game where players take turns rolling dice to accumulate points, aiming to reach the target score first. However, beware of "tuple out" situations where all dice show the same value, resulting in zero points for the round.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Rules

1. **Starting the Game**:
   - Each player rolls three dice per turn.
   - The game ends when a player reaches or exceeds the target score (default: 30 points).

2. **Fixed Dice**:
   - If two dice show the same value (e.g., `4, 4, 5`), these dice are "fixed" and cannot be rerolled.
   - Only the remaining non-fixed dice can be rerolled.

3. **Tupled Out**:
   - If all three dice show the same value (e.g., `3, 3, 3`), the player "tuples out," scoring **0 points** for the round.

4. **Rerolling**:
   - Players can reroll non-fixed dice multiple times until they either decide to stop or tuple out.
   - Fixed dice remain the same during rerolls.

5. **Stopping**:
   - Players can stop rerolling at any point during their turn to lock in their current score for the round.

6. **Timeout**:
   - Players have a limited time (30 seconds) to decide whether to reroll or stop.
   - If a player fails to respond within the timeout, they forfeit their reroll and keep the current dice.

7. **Winning**:
   - The first player to reach or exceed the target score (30 points) wins the game.
